## Hello, my name is Aubrey ðŸ‘‹

I craft accessible and seamless interfaces for the web.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on CycleSpots and an upcoming learning app for self-taught artists.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning front-end development, working with databases, and the foundations of computer graphics.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about art periods, The Last of Us, and what makes a good-looking interface.
