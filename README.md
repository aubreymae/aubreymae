## Hello world, my name is Aubrey 👋

I craft accessible and seamless interfaces for the web (and potentially beyond-- I have a growing interest in computer graphics).

- 🔭 I’m currently working on CycleSpots and an upcoming learning app for self-taught artists.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning front-end development and working with databases.
- 💬 Ask me about art periods, The Last of Us, and what makes a good-looking interface. 
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm currently pursuing OMSCS online and part-time! Prior to this, I finished the 3D asset program at Think Tank Training Centre.
